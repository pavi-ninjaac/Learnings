The outcome of a \\ndeterministic system is fixed, while the outcome of a stochastic process is uncertain. The \\ndynamics of stochastic processes are described by random variables and probability \\ndistributions.  \\nThe order of random variables is indicated by indexing each random variable in the family \\nby a subscript. The ordering is a result of the random variables being observed over time.  \\nReferring to the examples of the  previous se ssion,  the maximum number of outcomes \\nobtained while rolling a di ce was the random variable  where i ndexing was done over the \\nnumber of throws of the d ice. ùëãùë° is the notation for the random variable that models the \\nvalue of the stochastic process at time t. The random variables in the set can be dependent \\nor independent of each other, reflecting the nature of the process being modelled.  In all \\nstochastic modell ing, a sample of data is collected from the process being modelled.  \\n2. Classification of Stochastic Process  \\nA stochastic process can be defined as a family of random variables, { ùëã(ùë°):ùë°‚ààùëá}, where ùë° \\ndenotes time , that is, at every time ùë° in the set ùëá, a random number ùëã(ùë°) is observed.  The \\nstochastic process is classified based on parameter space and state space . Each of these \\nis further classified based on their discreet and continuous nature . \\n \\nFigure 1: Classification of Stochastic Process  \\n \\n'),\n",

Here ùëá is the \\nparameter space and is discrete in nature. In practice, this means  ùëá={0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶}. In \\nother words, in a discrete -time process {ùëã(0), ùëã(1), ùëã(2),‚Ä¶} a random variable is \\nassociated with every time 0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶ \\n‚Ä¢ Continuous -Time Process  \\n{ùëã(ùë°):ùë°‚ààùëá} is a continuous -time process  if the set ùëá is not finite or countable.  In \\npractice, this means ùëá=[0,‚àû), ùëúùëü ùëá=[0,ùêæ) for some ùêæ. Thus, a continuous -time \\nprocess is {ùëã(ùë°):ùë°‚ààùëá} has a random number ùëã(ùë°) associated with every instant in \\ntime.  Note that,  ùëã(ùë°) need not  change at every instant in time, but it is allowed to \\nchange at any time.  That is, ùëã(ùë°) does not just change at ùë°=0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶, as seen in \\ndiscrete -time process.  \\n2.2 State Space  \\nThe State Space (ùëÜ) is the set of real values that ùëã(ùë°) can take (a random variable can take ). \\nThis collection of values is known as the state space. While tossing a coin, the state spaces  \\nare head and tail and while rolling a dice , state spaces  are all the possible outcomes - 1, 2, \\n3, 4, 5 and 6. Every ùëã(ùë°) takes a value in ‚Ñù, but ùëÜ will often be a smaller set ùëÜ ‚äÜ ‚Ñù. For example, \\nif ùëã(ùë°) is the outcome of a coin tossed at time ùë°, then the state space is ùëÜ={0,1}. This {0,1} \\nrepresents the real number values for the sample space of random variable ùëã. The \\nstochastic process can be in the state space ùëÜ (the set of states ). The state space ( ùëÜ) is \\ndiscrete if it is finite or countable. Otherwise, it is continuous . \\n2.3 Discrete and  Continuous Property  \\nThe classification of a stochastic process depends on the two possible values of the state \\nspace and the parameter space  which  is discrete and continuous property.

Discrete random sequence:  It is t he stochastic process  in which  both state and \\nparameter space is discrete in nature, i.e., Discrete -Time and Discrete -State processes . \\nHence, a nother name for Discrete Random Sequence is Discrete -Time and Discrete -\\nState process.   \\nLet us look at a few examples of discrete random sequences.  \\nExample 1:  Let the number of i ndividuals in a population at the end of year ùë° be ùëã(ùë°). \\nHere, the random variable is number of individuals in a population at the end of year ùë°, \\nand ùë° is the  indexing parameter. Then the stochastic process {ùëã(ùë°):ùë°‚ààùëá} is a discreet \\nrandom sequence  where, time ùëá={0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶} and the state space ùëÜ={0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶} . ùëá \\nis a set of values that are discrete in nature and the state space is also discrete in \\nnature.  \\nExample 2: Suppose, a motor insurance company reviews the status of its customers \\nyearly, then there are three levels of discounts given (0%, 10% , 25% ) depending on \\nthe accident record of the driver. Let ùëã(ùë°) be the percentage of discount at the end of \\nyear t. The  stochastic process is given by {ùëã(ùë°):ùë°‚ààùëá}, where ùëá={0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶} and the \\nstate space ùëÜ={0,10,25}.

Discrete random process:  When the parameter space is cont inuous  in nature and the \\nstate space is discrete in nature, then such stochastic process is known as discrete \\nrandom process.  \\nLet us look at a few examples of discrete random processes.  \\nExample 1:  Let the number of incoming  calls in an interval [0,ùë°] be ùëã(ùë°), where ùëã(ùë°) is \\nthe random variable and [0,ùë°] is the interval over which the number of incoming calls \\nis recorded. Then, the stochastic process given by the collection of these random \\nvariables { ùëã(ùë°):ùë°‚ààùëá}, has ùëá={ùë°:0‚â§ùë°<‚àû} and the state space ùëÜ={0,1,‚Ä¶}. Here,  \\nparameter space is continuous and state s pace is discrete in nature . \\nExample 2:  Let the number of cars parked at a commercial centre in the time interval \\n[0,ùë°] be ùëã(ùë°). Therefore, the stochastic process is given by { ùëã(ùë°):ùë°‚ààùëá}, where ùëá=\\n{ùë°:0‚â§ùë°<‚àû} and the state space ùëÜ={0,1,‚Ä¶}. Here, the parameter s pace is \\ncontinuous in nature and the state space is discrete in nature because it represents \\nthe number of cars.  \\n3. Continuous random sequence:  When the parameter space is discrete in nature and the \\nstate space is continuous in nature, then such  stochastic process is known as \\ncontinuous random sequence.  \\nLet us look at a few examples of continuous random sequences.  \\nExample 1:   The share price for an asset at the close of trading on day ‚Äòt‚Äô  with ùëá=\\n{0,1,2,‚Ä¶} and ùëÜ={ùë•:0‚â§ùë•< ‚àû}. Here, share price s can take any value from the real \\nnumber system which makes it continuous in nature.  \\nExample 2:  Let ùëã(ùëõ) represent the maximum temperature in a certain place on the \\nearth‚Äôs surface on the ùëõth day, where ùëá={1,2,3,‚Ä¶} and say, ùëÜ=[‚àí90,60] degree \\ncelsius. He re, the state space is continuous in nature, whereas the parameter space \\ncan only take the discrete values.  \\n4.

Deterministic Model  \\nA deterministic model is a mathematical or computational representation of a system or \\nprocess in whi ch the outcome is fully determined (completely certain) by the initial \\nconditions and the underlying rules or laws that govern the system. A  deterministic  \\nmodel  allows you to calculate a future event exactly without the involvement of \\nrandomness. If the ou tcome of an experiment is certain (always the same), it is a \\ndeterministic  experiment .  \\nSome examples of deterministic model  are as follows : \\n‚Ä¢ A simple physics model that describes the motion of an object under known forces.  \\n‚Ä¢ A computer simulation of a manufacturing process that follows a fixed set of rules.  \\n‚Ä¢ A mathematical model of a machine learning algorithm that predicts outcomes based \\non input data.  \\nHence, in a deterministic model everything is ‚Äòcertain ‚Äô as it works under fixed initial \\nconditions whi ch results in fixed outcomes  and zero  involvement of randomness.  \\n2. Stochastic Model  \\nStochastic model is the model  that includes random variables.  \\nSome examples of Stochastic model are as follows:  \\n‚Ä¢ Stock market model : It takes random fluctuations into account in stock prices . \\n‚Ä¢ Weather forecasting model : It includes random variations in atmospheric conditions . \\n‚Ä¢ Population growth model : It includes random fluctuations in birth and death rates  in \\nthe population . \\nLet‚Äôs consider an example of bacterial growth . In the deterministic growth model, number  of \\nbacteria presents  after ùë° minutes  can be determined . The deterministic growth model is to \\nassert the population of bacteria ‚Äôs grow th at a fixed rate, like 20% per minute  with zero \\nrandomness involved. The deterministic model does not address the uncertainty present in \\nthe reproduction rate of individual organisms.  \\n '),\n",

In many \\nbiological processes, the exponential distribution is a common choice for modelling the time \\nof birth and death. A simple stochastic gro wth model assumes that the time taken by \\nindividual bacterium to reproduce is an independent exponential random variable ‚Äîfor \\nexample, say, with a rate parameter of 0.20.  \\nSince r andomness  can be included in the model , by applying the stochastic processes or  \\nthe stochastic model,  the dynamics of the system  can be studied in a better way .  \\nIt helps to answer the following questions : \\n1. What is the average number of bacteria present at time t such as after 10 min, 1 hour, \\nor a day?  \\n2. What is the probability that the number of bacteria will exceed some threshold after t \\nminutes?  \\n3. What is the distribution of the time taken by the bacteria to double in size?  \\n4. What is the likelihood that the populatio n goes extinct, or reaches a long -term \\nequilibrium?  \\nTherefore, in all cases probability is used for the quantification of uncertainty in the syste m \\nwhich makes the stochastic model much  better than the deterministic model.  \\n3. Prerequisites  for Stochastic Proc ess \\nThere are some prerequisites that are required to be known , before implementing a  \\nstochastic process . They are:  \\n‚Ä¢ Experiment : It is a measurement proce dure  or observation process.  \\n‚Ä¢ Outcome : It is the result of an experiment , where if one outcome occurs, then no other \\noutcome can occur at the same time. For example, when  a coin is tossed , obtaining  a \\nhead or tail is an outcome.  \\n‚Ä¢ Random Experiment : It is a well-defined  procedure that produces an observable \\noutcome that could not be perfectly predicted in advance.  \\n‚Ä¢ Event : It is a single outcome or a collection of outcomes of an experiment.

Examples of Stochastic Process  \\nConsider a simple experiment like throwing true dice.  \\n‚Ä¢ Example 1  \\nSuppose that ùëãùëõ is the outcome of the nth throw, n‚â•1. Since  it\\'s a throw, it will always \\nbe greater than equals to one. Here , {ùëãùëõ,ùëõ‚â•1} is a family of random variables such \\nthat for a distinct value of n (1,2‚Ä¶), one gets a distinct random variable ùëãùëõ;{ùëãùëõ,ùëõ‚â•\\n1}. It constitutes a stochastic process, known as B ernoulli process.  \\n‚Ä¢ Example 2 \\nSuppose that ùëãùëõ is the number of sixes in the first ùëõ throws. For a distinct value of ùëõ=\\n1,2,‚Ä¶, we get a distinct binomial variable ùëãùëõ;{ùëãùëõ,ùëõ‚â•1} which gives a family of random \\nvariables,  and this  is also a stochastic process.  \\n‚Ä¢ Example 3  \\nSuppose that ùëãùëõ is the maximum number shown in the first ùëõ throws. Here, {ùëãùëõ,ùëõ‚â•1} \\nconstitutes a stochastic process.  For example, s uppose  \"ùëõ\" is the n umber  of times a \\ndice is thrown then if ùëõ=1, and if maximum value is 6,  then  ùëã1=6. Similarly, if ùëõ=2 \\nand then ùëã2=4 and if ùëõ=3 and then ùëã3=5. Here,  ùëã will become ùëã1, ùëã2, ùëã3. So, these \\nwill become the  different values of random variables . Here a gain,  {ùëãùëõ,ùëõ‚â•1} which \\ngives a family of random va riables is a stochastic process.  \\n‚Ä¢ Example 4 \\nConsider that there are r cells and an infinitely large number of identical balls that are \\nthrown at random, one by one, into the cells. Assume that the ball being thrown is \\nequally likely to go into any of the cells.  Suppose that Xn is the number of occupied \\ncells after n throws.  Then {Xn,n‚â•1} constitutes a stochastic process.  \\n‚Ä¢ Example 5  \\nConsider a random event occurring in time, such as the number of telephone calls \\nreceived at a switchboard. Suppose that X(t) is the random variable which represents \\nthe number of incoming calls in an interval (0,t) of duration t units. Here, the random \\nvariable is the number of incoming calls.

They are:  \\n‚Ä¢ Experiment : It is a measurement proce dure  or observation process.  \\n‚Ä¢ Outcome : It is the result of an experiment , where if one outcome occurs, then no other \\noutcome can occur at the same time. For example, when  a coin is tossed , obtaining  a \\nhead or tail is an outcome.  \\n‚Ä¢ Random Experiment : It is a well-defined  procedure that produces an observable \\noutcome that could not be perfectly predicted in advance.  \\n‚Ä¢ Event : It is a single outcome or a collection of outcomes of an experiment.'),\n",
